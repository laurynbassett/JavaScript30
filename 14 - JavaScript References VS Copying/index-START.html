    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const sliceCopy = players.slice()
    console.log('slice copy: ', sliceCopy)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const concatCopy = [].concat(players)
    console.log('concat copy: ', concatCopy)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spreadCopy = [...players]
    console.log('spread copy: ', spreadCopy)

    // or with Array.from
    const arrayCopy = Array.from(players)
    console.log('array copy: ', arrayCopy)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    sliceCopy.push('Lauryn')
    console.log('slice copy after push', sliceCopy)
    console.log('players after pushing to slice copy: ', players)

    concatCopy.push('Lauryn')
    console.log('concat copy after push: ', concatCopy)
    console.log('players after pushing to concat copy: ', players)

    spreadCopy.push('Lauryn')
    console.log('spread copy after push: ', spreadCopy)
    console.log('players after pushing to spread copy: ', players)

    arrayCopy.push('Lauryn')
    console.log('array copy after push: ', spreadCopy)
    console.log('players after pushing to array copy: ', players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const copyObj = Object.assign({}, person)
    console.log('copy object: ', copyObj)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const spreadObj = {...person}
    console.log('spread object: ', spreadObj)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const jsonObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log('JSON object: ', jsonObj)

    person.number = 10
    console.log('copy object: ', copyObj)
    console.log('spread object: ', spreadObj)
    console.log('JSON object: ', jsonObj)
    console.log('person object: ', person)
